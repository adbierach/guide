###Why this guide?###

Every year millions of people spend the majority of their waking hours in front of a computer.
We sit on the way to work, sit all day at work, sit on the way home, and sit when we get home.

The modern desk job, can take a toll on our well-being. 

Fortunately adopting a few good habits can go a long way in managing these problems. 

This guide was born out of the belief that most of us need more mobility and mindfullness at our desks, and that 
learning skills for sitting well will not only bring us greater productivity and health in the short-term, but in the long-term 
can help prevent a host of work-related injuries from a sedentary job with long hours of computer use. 

It will review important scientific research and best practices for overcoming the mental and physical stresses of being a knowledge worker.

It is a living document and will grow and change as the demands of work change and as we learn more about how to work smarter and feel better.
